!!WARNING!!

THIS IS NOT YOUR REGULAR README!
This is from a course on [Pluralsight](pluralsight.com).
As at when I created this repo (Ocotober 14, 2021, 2:13 am), I know absolutely nothing in Javazcript. I just followed whatever the instructor did.

This is a website for a mini bakery. There's not much to it but it has a home page, a page that shows the pies for sale(just two, hehe), a contact page and an order form.
